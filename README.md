#Feedback from Professor Mehta (12 January 2021)
<ul>
	<li>(Prof) The search/dropdown issue might be a negotiable user story - when you insert “a” then countries beginning with “a” start populating, or make the drop box case insensitive.</li>
	<li>(Policymaker) Some standardized messaging on public health from CDC or WHO.</li>
	<li>(HKS Students) you should have a link to your product board, a note that this was developed using an agile framework, the list of our roles, and a blurb about what each person did.</li>
	<li>(Tina) Make date more readable/ accessible.</li>
	<li>(Tina) See a list of “all the countries that are blue?” because I do not know my geography well/ more information about countries on the map.</li>
</ul>

#Feedback from code4policy class (12 January 2021)
<ul>
	<li>Emily: (Tina) Couldn't find the search  bar herself - color, and link info to government webpages (ex: TZ).</li>
	<li>Rose: (Tina) Would like warmer tones for background. Capitalizing the country could be confusing for the search bar. Responsive design for the table on About This Page.</li>
	<li>Keita: (Tina) Could not understand the numbers and went back-and-forth to About This Page. Interested in 'Targetted' vs. 'General' country information.</li>
	<li>Johanna: (Tina) Can we use a harvey ball to visually show strictness to save users from navigating to the About This Page. Map should remove 'school closings', 'work closings', etc. if just Tina the Tourist.</li>
	<li>Chungho: (Tina) Wants Wendy the Wanderlust to be involved - domestic stringency not as important to him than international travel in the first place.</li>
	<li>Leonie: (Tina) Got frustrated she couldn't press “enter” to look at the country.</li>
	<li>Scott: (Tina) Keep search engine default to wide</li>
</ul>

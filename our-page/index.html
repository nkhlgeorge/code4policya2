    <p>Thank you for visiting the first version of our web application.  Using a <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker">dataset</a> managed by the wonderful people at Oxford University, we're trying to simplify the process for you - a traveler - to better understand the quickly changing COVID-19 restrictions in place around the world by summarizing the important details in a single location. Right now, this includes three pieces of information, with possible values summarized in the below table:</p>

    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
            <th>Question</th>
            <th>Restriction Level</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="4">Can I use public transportation?</th>
            <td>0 - No measures</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1 - Recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2 - Require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Blank - No data</td>
        </tr>
        <th rowspan="6">Do I need to quarantine upon arrival?</th>
            <td>0 - No restrictions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1 - Screening arrivals</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2 - Quarantine arrivals from some or all regions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3 - Ban arrivals from some regions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4 - Ban on all regions or total border closure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Blank - No data</td>
        </tr>
        <th rowspan="6">Do I need to quarantine upon arrival?</th>
            <td>0 - No policy</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1 - Recommended</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2 - Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3 - Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4 - Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>What's coming next?</h2>
    <p>Right now, our site is pretty basic, but we have some big ideas for ways we might add to it! Here are some that we're working on:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Giving an idea of open destinations for someone who doesn't care where they head - as long as it's somewhere else</li>
            
            <li>Showing public health officials how their peers in other countries are responding to the pandemic's ebbs and flows</li>
            
            <li>Helping corporate leaders understand which economies are open for business</li>
        </ul>
    <p>If you are interested in giving any enhancement suggestions or if you encounter a bug, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/vicyingc/code4policya2/issues">Github</a> page!</p>

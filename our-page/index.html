    <p>Thank you for visiting the first version of our web application.  Using a <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker">dataset</a> managed by the wonderful people at Oxford University, we're trying to simplify the process for you - a traveler - to better understand the quickly changing COVID-19 restrictions in place around the world by summarizing the important details in one, single location. Right now, this includes three pieces of information, with possible values summarized in the below table:</p>
    <img src="./Possible-Restrictions-Table.png" alt="List of possible restriction values returned by our tool" width="1000" height="484">
    <h2>What's coming next?</h2>
    <p>Right now, our site is pretty basic, but we have some big ideas for ways we might add to it! Here are some that we're working on:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Giving an idea of open destinations for someone who doesn't care where they head - as long as it's somewhere else</li>
            
            <li>Showing public health officials how their peers in other countries are responding to the pandemic's ebbs and flows</li>
            
            <li>Helping corporate leaders understand which economies are open for business</li>
        </ul>
    <p>If you are interested in giving any enhancement suggestions or if you encounter a bug, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/vicyingc/code4policya2/issues">Github</a> page!</p>
